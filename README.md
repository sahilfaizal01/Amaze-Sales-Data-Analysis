# Sales-Data-Analysis
## Problem Statement:-
Amaze is a hardware solutions company operating in multiple locations within India. The leadership team noticed a steep decline in overall revenue despite receiving positive sales reports from regional managers in different states. This led the management to hire a data analyst to find key insights from the data collected from the nationwide offices. As a part of this, the analyst is provided with a SQL sales database containing multiple tables related to the transactions, offices, product details, etc. The assigned task is to design an interactive dashboard containing region-wise and data-wise sales insights to make an effective decision.
